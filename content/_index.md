<h1 style="margin:0em"> ðŸŒ´ L.A. based comedy writer and actor. ðŸŒ´</h1>

Hi! My name is Tao (pronounced tay-oh {{< audio mp3="tao.mp3" >}}). I am a Chinese-American immigrant and became a citizen the day after President Obama got elected. I was a CollegeHumor cast member and wrote and starred in dozens of videos which you can see [here](/videos).!

I have years of sketch writing experience both online and on stage. I write comedy that is both incredibly stupid with strong points of view like this video about how [corporate ice-breakers are stupid](https://youtu.be/5T35KaUxiSU).

I'm also on the Upright Citizen's Brigade house improv team, *[Jetset](https://ucbcomedy.com/user/42774)*, which you can see either Monday, Thursday, or Friday nights at UCB in LA.

Prior to L.A., I was a writer on a house sketch team (aka Maude Night) at the Upright Citizen's Brigade in NYC. 

I also have life experience outside of comedy! I've had a whole other career as a Data Scientist (translation: programmer + stats) and have worked at data-driven organizations like Backstage, Grubhub/Seamless, and tumblr. I even coded the pixels that you're looking at right now with just my bare hands and a hammer.
